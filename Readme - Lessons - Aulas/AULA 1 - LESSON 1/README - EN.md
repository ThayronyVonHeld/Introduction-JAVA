# 📚 Lesson 1

History and Evolution of Java  
Origins

---

- **1990** – Created at Sun Microsystems, led by James Gosling.

- Initial goal: develop a technology to allow communication between devices.

- First attempts were made in C++, but the language’s complexity led to the creation of something new.

### Early Steps

- The Green Project: a team of developers dedicated to the new language.

- Initial name: GreenTalk.

- **1991** – Renamed Oak.

### Early Projects

- Star Seven: a portable controller aimed at home entertainment (set-top box).

- Duke: the language’s mascot/assistant.

### From the Drawer to the Web

**1992** – The project was shelved due to lack of funding.

**1994** – At the same time, Tim Berners-Lee was developing HTML. The idea of interactivity became the link between Oak and the Web.

- The Web Runner project emerged, an experimental browser.

### Naming the Language

- Issue: the name Oak was already patented.

- After several suggestions, the name Java was chosen – inspired by “Java Coffee” (strong coffee).

- Web Runner was renamed HotJava.

### Consolidation

- The main focus was interactivity: connecting internal and external devices seamlessly.

**2004** – NASA used Java in communication with robots on Mars.

- Java became popular as a reliable, secure, and cross-platform language.

### Java as Open Source

**2006** – Java became open source under the GPLv3 license.

- This strengthened the open-source ecosystem (Linux, Firefox, Chrome, PHP, WordPress, Blender, among others).

### A New Era

**2009** – Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle.

**2010** – James Gosling left the company.

### Real-World Applications of Java

- Credit cards – chips read through Java-based interfaces.

- Android – systems and apps built in Java.

- Blu-ray – controlled by Java.

- Kindle – powered by Java.
