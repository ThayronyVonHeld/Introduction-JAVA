# 📚 Lesson 1

History and Evolution of Java

---

### Origins

- **1990** – Created at **Sun Microsystems**, led by **James Gosling**.
- Initial goal: build a technology to enable **communication between devices**.
- Early attempts were made with **C++**, but its complexity motivated the creation of something new.

---

### Early Steps

- **The Green Project**: team dedicated to the development of the new language.
- Initial name: **GreenTalk**.
- **1991** – Renamed to **Oak**.

---

### Early Projects

- **Star Seven**: a portable controller aimed at home entertainment (set-top box).
- **Duke**: the language’s mascot/assistant.

---

### From the Drawer to the Web

- **1992** – Project shelved due to lack of funding.
- **1994** – At the same time, **Tim Berners-Lee** was developing **HTML**.
    - The idea of **interactivity** became the link between Oak and the Web.
- The project **Web Runner** emerged, an experimental browser.

---

### Naming the Language

- Issue: the name **Oak** was already patented.
- After several suggestions, the name **Java** was chosen – inspired by **“Java Coffee” (strong coffee)**.
- **Web Runner** was renamed **HotJava**.

---

### Consolidation

- The key differentiator: **interactivity**, connecting internal and external devices.
- **2004** – **NASA** used Java to communicate with robots on Mars.
- Java consolidated itself as a **reliable, secure, and cross-platform** language.

---

### Java as Open Source

- **2006** – Java became **open source**, under the **GPLv3** license.
- This move strengthened the open-source ecosystem (Linux, Firefox, Chrome, PHP, WordPress, Blender, among others).

---

### A New Era

- **2009** – **Sun Microsystems** was acquired by **Oracle**.
- **2010** – James Gosling left the company.

---

### Real-World Applications of Java

- **Credit cards** – chips read through Java-based interfaces.
- **Android** – systems and applications built in Java.
- **Blu-ray** – controlled by Java.
- **Kindle** – powered by Java.
